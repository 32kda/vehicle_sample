# Vehicle Example

This project is aimed at creating 'sandbox' game to test the following Godot 4 3D Game features

This demo/sandbox is inspired by old PS1 "Twisted Metal" game, as well as some techniques used in Half-Life 1 and Couter-Strike 1.6

* Basic Car Physics using VehicleBody3D
* Car auto-driving - bsic, later - maybe using some Neural Network architectures
* Main Menu and HUD creation, game pausing and restarting
* Using Paths for creating track
* Using 3D Terrain plugin
* Creating Weapns - HitScan and Particle ones
* Using Godot Particles, Sprites and Decals for creating different effects - explosions, bullet holes, water etc.
* Models importing - planning to make this using Free/OpenSource Software, like awesome Blender and Krita
* Physics

Some art being used is downloaded from free art sites like opengameart.org or https://open3dmodel.com , some is created by me in Blender and Krita
